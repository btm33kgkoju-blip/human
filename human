        <h2>Facts about humans</h2>
         <p>
             Humans are the most intelligent animals on Earth. They are also the youngest organisms to 
             exist in this world.But today, they are the strongest and most lethal animals to have walked 
             on the Earth. Equipt with nuclear technology and guns, they can kill almost every organism on 
             the Earth. Humans have also created languages and units that help create the understanding
             of this world easier.For example, time, temperature etc.
